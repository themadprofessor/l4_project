%How good is your solution? How well did you solve the general problem, and what evidence do you have to support that?
%
%\section{Guidance}
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item
%        Ask specific questions that address the general problem.
%    \item
%        Answer them with precise evidence (graphs, numbers, statistical
%        analysis, qualitative analysis).
%    \item
%        Be fair and be scientific.
%    \item
%        The key thing is to show that you know how to evaluate your work, not
%        that your work is the most amazing product ever.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\section{Evidence}
%Make sure you present your evidence well. Use appropriate visualisations, reporting techniques and statistical analysis, as appropriate.
%
%If you visualise, follow the basic rules, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:boxplot}:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Label everything correctly (axis, title, units).
%\item Caption thoroughly.
%\item Reference in text.
%\item \textbf{Include appropriate display of uncertainty (e.g. error bars, Box plot)}
%\item Minimize clutter.
%\end{itemize}
%
%See the file \texttt{guide\_to\_visualising.pdf} for further information and guidance.

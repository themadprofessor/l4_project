%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    Network programming has been build around the Berkeley Sockets API since its inception in 1983.
    While the simplicity of this API, which abstracted file I/O and network I/O to a similar interface,
    is a testament to its longevity, modern network programming has changed in a manner which requires
    amounts of boilerplate code.
    This projects aims to investigate the possibility of a high-level API which removes the boilerplate
    associated with Berkeley sockets, and provide a protocol-agnostic, asynchronous API to application developers.

%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not

%
% From now on pages are numbered

% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 
%
% Do not alter the bibliography style.
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 30 pages for a

% to but excluding the appendices and bibliography.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

\pagenumbering{arabic}

The way programs have interacted with networks has not changed since the 1980s with the creation of the Berkeley Sockets
API (BSD Sockets).
Since then, what programs use networks for, and the amount programs use networks has changed drastically, but they all
continue to use the same BSD Sockets API .
BSD Sockets have become less applicable as the standard API over the years, but no API has been able to replace it.

BSD Sockets was designed to be a simple API which followed the same structure as local file access APIs.
While this approach likely contributed to the APIs widespread use and longevity, it does not match the true nature of
networks.
File access is a largely synchronous and reliable operation with limited customisation options for how to carry out the
operation.
Networking is inherently asynchronous and unreliable in its operation, and operates on a customisable protocol stack.
While BSD Sockets has been extended over the years to support asynchronous operations with its non-blocking mode, it is
extremely error prone and cumbersome to use.
BSD Sockets does expose a mechanism to customise the protocol stack, but it requires the user of the API to select which
protocols and has a limited selection of protocols, which are specified by the operating system.

The aim of this project is to design and implement a new networking API which overcomes the limitations of the BSD
Sockets API .
The API will be exclusively asynchronous and raise the level of the networking stack the user works with.
It will expose a mechanism to decouple the user from the underlying protocol stack, while allowing the user to specify
constraints on the possible protocols which can be used.

Three major attempts to create a modern alternative to BSD Sockets have been attempted: Post Sockets, NEAT and TAPS.
Post Sockets is an API which aims to decouple programs from the transport-layer protocols
(See Section~\ref{sec:post-sockets}).
NEAT is an API which aims to allow transport-layer protocols to be implemented in user-space
(See Section~\ref{sec:neat}).
TAPS is an API which aims to provide a unified API for connections which communicate the same data conceptually
(See Section~\ref{sec:taps}).

The structure of this document is as follows.
First, a discussion of Post Sockets, NEAT and TAPS as the major infulences of this work, and the Rust programming
language, in Chapter~\ref{ch:background}.
Then in Chapter~\ref{ch:analysis/requirements}, the requirements for the projects are outlined and discussed.
Chapter~\ref{ch:design} then discusses the high-level design of the API the project will create.
Following on from that is a discussion of the implementation of the API in Chapter~\ref{ch:implementation}.
With the implementation in place, Chapter~\ref{ch:evaluation} evaluates the design and the implementation of the API .
Finally, Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion} discusses possible future work on the project and concludes the document.

%Why should the reader care about what are you doing and what are you actually doing?
%\section{Guidance}
%
%\textbf{Motivate} first, then state the general problem clearly.
%
%\section{Writing guidance}
%\subsection{Who is the reader?}
%
%This is the key question for any writing. Your reader:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item
%    is a trained computer scientist: \emph{don't explain basics}.
%    \item
%    has limited time: \emph{keep on topic}.
%    \item
%    has no idea why anyone would want to do this: \emph{motivate clearly}
%    \item
%    might not know \emph{anything} about your project in particular:
%    \emph{explain your project}.
%    \item
%    but might know precise details and check them: \emph{be precise and
%    strive for accuracy.}
%    \item
%    doesn't know or care about you: \emph{personal discussions are
%    irrelevant}.
%\end{itemize}
%
%Remember, you will be marked by your supervisor and one or more members
%of staff. You might also have your project read by a prize-awarding
%committee or possibly a future employer. Bear that in mind.

%\subsection{References and style guides}
%There are many style guides on good English writing. You don't need to
%read these, but they will improve how you write.

%\begin{itemize}
    %\item
    %\emph{How to write a great research paper} \cite{Pey17} (\textbf{recommended}, even though you aren't writing a research paper)
    %\item
    %\emph{How to Write with Style} \cite{Von80}. Short and easy to read. Available online.
    %\item
    %\emph{Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace} \cite{Wil09} A very popular modern English style guide.
    %\item
    %\emph{Politics and the English Language} \cite{Orw68}  A famous essay on effective, clear writing in English.
    %\item
    %\emph{The Elements of Style} \cite{StrWhi07} Outdated, and American, but a classic.
    %\item
    %\emph{The Sense of Style} \cite{Pin15} Excellent, though quite in-depth.
%\end{itemize}

%\subsubsection{Citation styles}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item If you are referring to a reference as a noun, then cite it as: ``\citet{Orw68} discusses the role of language in political thought.''
%\item If you are referring implicitly to references, use: ``There are many good books on writing \citep{Orw68, Wil09, Pin15}.''
%\end{itemize}

%There is a complete guide on good citation practice by Peter Coxhead available here: \url{http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxc/refs/index.html}.

%\begin{highlight_title}{WARNING}

%    If you include material from other sources without full and correct attribution, you are commiting plagiarism. The penalties for plagiarism are severe.
%    Quote any included text and cite it correctly. Cite all images, figures, etc. clearly in the caption of the figure.

\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
The aim of this project was to define a modern alternative to the BSD Sockets API .
BSD Sockets was defined in the 1980s, and has continued to be the standard networking API, dispite it not being fit for
modern networked programs.
%Summarise the whole project for a lazy reader who didn't read the rest (e.g. a prize-awarding committee).
%\section{Guidance}
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item
%        Summarise briefly and fairly.
%    \item
%        You should be addressing the general problem you introduced in the
%        Introduction.
%    \item
%        Include summary of concrete results (``the new compiler ran 2x
%        faster'')
%    \item
%        Indicate what future work could be done, but remember: \textbf{you
%        won't get credit for things you haven't done}.

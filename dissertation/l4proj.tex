%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    Network programming has been build around the Berkeley Sockets API since its inception in 1983.
    While the simplicity of this API, which abstracted file I/O and network I/O to a similar interface,
    is a testament to its longevity, modern network programming has changed in a manner which requires
    amounts of boilerplate code.
    This projects aims to investigate the possibility of a high-level API which removes the boilerplate
    associated with Berkeley sockets, and provide a protocol-agnostic, asynchronous API to application developers.

%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not

%
% From now on pages are numbered
% using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call
% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 
%
% Do not alter the bibliography style.
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 30 pages for a 
% 20 credit report. This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up
% to but excluding the appendices and bibliography.

% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

\pagenumbering{arabic}

The Berkeley socket API (BSD sockets) allows an application to communicate over the Internet since 1983.
A key reason for its longevity is how a network socket is treated in the same way as a local file, once the socket has
been created.
This allows a programmer with understanding of local file I/O to work with network sockets.
While this model of network I/O has some similarities to local file I/O, in reality they are distinct and should be
treated as such.
One prime example of this is how network I/O has a range of protocols which can be used at each layer of the networking
stack, each providing different grantees and properties, and the application must specify which protocol stack to use.
Whereas in file I/O, there exists a protocol stack (file systems, storage interface, etc), but the application does not
need to manipulate the stack, as each protocol is a platform-specific way to handle the same operations.

Since BSD sockets required applications to decide the protocol stack, changing protocols would require the application
to be modified.
This may have contributed to the slow adoption of IPv6, since every application would have to be rewritten to use IPv6
rather than only the network implementation.
BSD sockets defined the default protocol to handle streams and datagrams are TCP and UDP, respectively.
While this may have aided in the adoption of these protocols and the growth of the Internet, it also hindered the
development of alternative protocols such as DCCP and SCTP .

Furthermore, BSD sockets exposes a synchronous API, providing blocking I/O .
Modern programming practices have changed to encourage the use of non-blocking I/O through the use of an asynchronous
API .
An asynchronous API allows the application to pass scheduling I/O calls to the implementation, often providing better
performance.

To resolve the above issues, a new networking API must be created.
Such an API must be protocol-agnostic and asynchronous, while allowing not reducing the possible uses of the API in
comparison to BSD sockets.
By being protocol-agnostic, the API decouples applications from the transport-layer, allowing new protocols to be
designed and used without applications having to be modified.
Modern network programming relies on asynchronous networking, which previously would require boilerplate over BSD
sockets.
By having the API be asynchronous, this boilerplate can be removed.

The aim of this project is to create an API which fulfills these requirements, and evaluate it in comparison to BSD
sockets.
The IETF Transport Services API will provide the overall design of the API, and Rust will be the implementation language
used.
Rust provides high-level safety with low-level performance and access, while also having be designed with concurrent
programming in mind.


%Why should the reader care about what are you doing and what are you actually doing?
%\section{Guidance}
%
%\textbf{Motivate} first, then state the general problem clearly.
%
%\section{Writing guidance}
%\subsection{Who is the reader?}
%
%This is the key question for any writing. Your reader:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item
%    is a trained computer scientist: \emph{don't explain basics}.
%    \item
%    has limited time: \emph{keep on topic}.
%    \item
%    has no idea why anyone would want to do this: \emph{motivate clearly}
%    \item
%    might not know \emph{anything} about your project in particular:
%    \emph{explain your project}.
%    \item
%    but might know precise details and check them: \emph{be precise and
%    strive for accuracy.}
%    \item
%    doesn't know or care about you: \emph{personal discussions are
%    irrelevant}.
%\end{itemize}
%
%Remember, you will be marked by your supervisor and one or more members
%of staff. You might also have your project read by a prize-awarding
%committee or possibly a future employer. Bear that in mind.

%\subsection{References and style guides}
%There are many style guides on good English writing. You don't need to
%read these, but they will improve how you write.

%\begin{itemize}
    %\item
    %\emph{How to write a great research paper} \cite{Pey17} (\textbf{recommended}, even though you aren't writing a research paper)
    %\item
    %\emph{How to Write with Style} \cite{Von80}. Short and easy to read. Available online.
    %\item
    %\emph{Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace} \cite{Wil09} A very popular modern English style guide.
    %\item
    %\emph{Politics and the English Language} \cite{Orw68}  A famous essay on effective, clear writing in English.
    %\item
    %\emph{The Elements of Style} \cite{StrWhi07} Outdated, and American, but a classic.
    %\item
    %\emph{The Sense of Style} \cite{Pin15} Excellent, though quite in-depth.
%\end{itemize}

%\subsubsection{Citation styles}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item If you are referring to a reference as a noun, then cite it as: ``\citet{Orw68} discusses the role of language in political thought.''
%\item If you are referring implicitly to references, use: ``There are many good books on writing \citep{Orw68, Wil09, Pin15}.''
%\end{itemize}

%There is a complete guide on good citation practice by Peter Coxhead available here: \url{http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxc/refs/index.html}.

%\subsection{Plagiarism warning}
%
%\begin{highlight_title}{WARNING}
%
%    If you include material from other sources without full and correct attribution, you are commiting plagiarism. The penalties for plagiarism are severe.
%    Quote any included text and cite it correctly. Cite all images, figures, etc. clearly in the caption of the figure.

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item
%        Summarise briefly and fairly.
%    \item
%        You should be addressing the general problem you introduced in the
%        Introduction.
%    \item
%        Include summary of concrete results (``the new compiler ran 2x
%        faster'')
%    \item
%        Indicate what future work could be done, but remember: \textbf{you
%        won't get credit for things you haven't done}.

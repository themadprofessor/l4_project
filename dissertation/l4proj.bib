High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.},

  abstract = {This document provides an overview of the architecture of Transport Services, a model for exposing transport protocol features to applications for network communication. In contrast to what is provided by most existing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Transport Services is based on an asynchronous, event-driven interaction pattern; it uses messages for representing data transfer to applications; and it assumes an implementation that can use multiple IP addresses, multiple protocols, and multiple paths, and provide multiple application streams. This document further defines the common set of terminology and concepts to be used in definitions of Transport Services APIs and implementations.},

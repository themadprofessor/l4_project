In contrast to what is provided by most existing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Transport Services is based on an asynchronous, event-driven interaction pattern; it uses messages for representing data transfer to applications; and it assumes an implementation that can use multiple IP addresses, multiple protocols, and multiple paths, and provide multiple application streams. This document further defines the common set of terminology and concepts to be used in definitions of Transport Services APIs and implementations.},
